# calculator
Simple calculator application built using Bootstrap 4, HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript with a Material UI Theme.

## Current Status
Currently building the logic for the key code events and click events on the calculator. Initial design is complete but I will go through it later and change the default colors for the Bootstrap theme.
