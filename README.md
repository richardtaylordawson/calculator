# Calculator
> Simple calculator application built using Bootstrap 4, HTML, ES6 Modules and multiple Bootstrap Themes from Bootswatch.

## Credits
Several projects aided in inspiring this project. Notably they are:

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/)

## Features
I added a feature to change the theme being applied to the page by using the options to the right of the calculator on desktop. I learned a lot from this on how to perform this action and how fun it is to see it change instantly.

In addition to click events, I added keyboard events for everything so a user can quickly calculate complicated equations.

## Run Project

$ npm install
$ npm start
